# SNN
Repository with several implementations of neural network models. 


## Eugene M. Izhikevich 
The code for this model was developed using the [paper](https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spikes.pdf) written by Izhikevich with the constant variables described at the document. This is the [Code](https://github.com/Jumaruba/SNN/blob/master/Izhikevich.py) for a single neuron.
