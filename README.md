# SNN
Repository with several implementations of neural network models. 


## Eugene M. Izhikevich 
The code for this model was developed using the [paper](https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spikes.pdf) written by Izhikevich with the constant variables described at the document. This is the [Code](Neurons/Izhikevich.py) for a single neuron.

## Hodgkin Huxel 

The code for this model was developed using the [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1392413/pdf/jphysiol01442-0106.pdf) and also equations and constants from [this pdf](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~bdoiron/assets/ermentrout-and-terman-ch-1.pdf).  
This is a [code](Neurons/HH.py) for a single neuron.

## LIF

The code for this model was developed using this [website](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch1.S3.html), with constants choosed by us.

This is a [code](Neurons/Ric_LIF.py) for a single neuron.
